All code contributions are done via Github so the first step to contributing is to [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

If you already have a fork, make sure it is up-to-date with the main repo. Always create your pull request branch off of the `master` branch.

**For Bug Fixes:**

- Branch off of `master`.
- Add regression tests for the bug.
- Once you've fixed the bug [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
- If there is an open issue addressing the bug, reference that issue in your pull request description.

**For New Features:**

- First open an issue to request the feature, describing it in as much detail as possible.
- Indicate that you would like to work on the feature in your issue.
- Once one of the Wartremover contributors okays the request, make your branch off of `master`.
- Once you've finished the feature with sufficient testing and documentation, make a pull request referencing the issue you made earlier.

**For Documentation:**

- Branch off of `master`.
- Submit a pull request with your changes.
